A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. Provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed. The scope of a document is any seralized object with a mime-type, so includes formal patient centric documents (CDA), cliical notes, scanned paper, and non-patient specific documents like policy text.

## Scope and Usage

### Overview
A flag is a warning or notification presented to users (clinicians or other healthcare providers) that:
- Represents significant information warranting special display
- Contains a subject that triggers its display
- Is typically shown as a prominent label in the patient record
- Should be concise and highlight high-priority issues

### Subject Types and Examples
Flags can reference different subject types:
- **Patient**: Overdue account notifications for discussion
- **Location**: Regional health alerts (e.g., Ebola outbreak risks)
- **Practitioner**: Provider availability status
- **Group**: Clinical trial enrollment
- **PlanDefinition**: Protocol-specific guidance
- **Medication**: Special approval requirements for drugs

### Common Use Cases
**Patient-Related Flags:**
- **Risk Factors**
  - Functional risk of falls
  - Spousal restraining orders
  - Latex allergy

- **Special Accommodations**
  - Hard of hearing
  - Need for easy-open caps

- **Provider Safety**
  - Presence of pets/animals
  - Potential aggressive behavior
  - Infection control precautions

- **Administrative**
  - Incomplete information
  - Pre-payment requirements

### Out of Scope
Flags should **not** be used for:
1. Potential allergy or drug interactions (use `DetectedIssue` instead)
2. Known adverse reactions (use `AllergyIntolerance` instead)

### Important Considerations
- Flags may contain information not captured elsewhere (e.g., "Patient has large dog at home")
- Create flags judiciously to prevent information overload
- Flags persist in records for defined periods
- Implementation guidelines vary by community
- While some information may be redundant (e.g., latex allergy), this redundancy serves a safety purpose

## Boundaries and Relationships
Flags may highlight a highly condensed view of information found in the AllergyIntolerance, Condition, Observation, Procedure and possibly other resources. A common extension allows the linkage of a Flag to the supporting detail resource. The purpose of these other resources is to provide detailed clinical information. The purpose of a Flag is to alert practitioners to information that is important to influence their interaction with a Patient prior to detailed review of the record.

Flags are not used to convey information to a specific individual or organization (e.g. an abnormal lab result reported to the ordering clinician, reporting of an adverse reaction to a regulatory authority). These are handled using the CommunicationRequest and the Communication resources.

Flags are not raised as a result of a reported or proposed action (e.g. drug-drug interactions, duplicate therapy warnings). These would be handled using DetectedIssue.
