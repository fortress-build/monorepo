## Scope and Usage
The Account resource is a central record against which charges, payments, and adjustments are applied. It contains information about which parties are responsible for payment of the account.

## Boundaries and Relationships
The Account itself does not include information about the charges, payments or adjustments, but rather those resources, such as ChargeItem point to the account to which they apply. Payment and adjustment resources have not yet been developed.

## Background and Context
The Account resource can be considered a "bucket" to which ChargeItem resources are linked. These charges are processed by a billing system, which determines the responsible parties for the balance of the account. The billing system then submits claims or sends statements to the appropriate parties. Once payment is received, an adjustment is applied to the Account. The internal calculation of balances and allocation of responsibility is expected to be internal to the billing systems. Only the inputs and outputs of the billing process is communicated in the relevant financial FHIR resources.
