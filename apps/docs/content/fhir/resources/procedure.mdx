## Scope and Usage

### Overview
Procedure is one of the event resources in the FHIR workflow specification. This resource records details of current and historical procedures performed on or for a patient.

### Definition
A procedure is an activity performed on, with, or for a patient as part of the provision of care. This includes:
- Clinical procedures (surgical, diagnostic, endoscopic, biopsies)
- Therapeutic services (counseling, physiotherapy)
- Support services (personal support, adult day care, non-emergency transportation)
- Lifestyle interventions (home modification, exercise)

### Performers
Procedures may be performed by:
- Healthcare professionals
- Service providers
- Friends or relatives
- The patient themselves

### Temporal Scope
- Provides summary information about procedure occurrence
- Not intended for real-time procedure tracking
- Can represent summary-level information for long-running procedures (e.g., psychotherapy progress)

## Boundaries and Relationships

### Resource Selection Guidelines
Do not use Procedure when a more specific resource exists for:
- Immunizations
- Drug administrations
- Communications

### Procedure vs Communication
The distinction is based on intent:
- **Communication**: Simple disclosure of information
- **Procedure**: Activities intended to:
  - Verify patient comprehension
  - Change patient's mental state
  - Provide training or counseling

### Diagnostic Procedures
- Many diagnostic processes generate Observations and DiagnosticReports
- Procedure record needed only when capturing details about physical intervention
- Examples of relevant details:
  - Anesthetic used
  - Incision details
  - Scope size

### Procedure vs Task
**Task**:
- Workflow steps (cancelling orders, fulfilling orders, signing orders)
- Administrative actions (merging records, admitting patients)

**Procedure**:
- Actions intended to create physical or mental change
- Clinical interventions (surgery, physiotherapy, training)
- Often connected to Tasks (e.g., Task requesting ServiceRequest for Procedure)
