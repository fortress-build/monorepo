## Scope and Usage
An ActivityDefinition is a shareable, consumable description of some activity to be performed. It may be used to specify actions to be taken as part of a workflow, order set, or protocol, or it may be used independently as part of a catalog of activities such as orderables.

For more information on how activity definitions can be used to construct request resources, see the Applying an ActivityDefinition topic below.

## Boundaries and Relationships
In general, an activity definition is simply a conceptual description of some specific action that should be taken. An instance of an ActivityDefinition does not indicate that any action has been performed (as an event resource does), nor does it indicate the actual intent to carry out any particular action (as a request resource does). Instead, an activity definition provides a reusable template that can be used to construct specific request resources such as ServiceRequest and MedicationRequest.

Note that this is conceptually similar to the [Task](/fhir/resources/task) resource as well, with the distinction being that ActivityDefinition represents the description of a task in the abstract, while the Task resource is used to track a specific instance of a task as it moves through the steps of a workflow.
