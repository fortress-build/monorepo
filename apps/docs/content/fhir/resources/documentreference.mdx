A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. Provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed. The scope of a document is any seralized object with a mime-type, so includes formal patient centric documents (CDA), cliical notes, scanned paper, and non-patient specific documents like policy text.

## Scope and Usage

A DocumentReference resource is used to index a document, clinical note, and other binary objects to make them available to a healthcare system. A document is some sequence of bytes that is identifiable, establishes its own context (e.g., what subject, author, etc. can be displayed to the user), and has defined update management. The DocumentReference resource can be used with any document format that has a recognized mime type and that conforms to this definition.

Typically, DocumentReference resources are used in document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS , such as profiled in IHE Mobile access to Health Documents .

DocumentReference is metadata describing a document such as:

* CDA documents in FHIR systems
* FHIR documents stored elsewhere (i.e. registry/repository following the XDS model)
* PDF documents, Scanned Paper, and digital records of faxes
* Clinical Notes in various forms
* Image files (e.g., JPEG, GIF, TIFF)
* Non-Standard formats (e.g., WORD)
* Other kinds of documents, such as records of prescriptions or immunizations

## Boundaries and Relationships

FHIR defines both a document format and this document reference. FHIR documents are for documents that are authored and assembled in FHIR. This resource is mainly intended for general references to assembled documents.

The document that is a target of the reference can be a reference to a FHIR document served by another server, or the target can be stored in the special FHIR Binary Resource, or the target can be stored on some other server system. The document reference is also able to address documents that are retrieved by a service call such as an XDS.b RetrieveDocumentSet, or a DICOM exchange, or an HL7 v2  message query - though the way each of these service calls works must be specified in some external standard or other documentation.

A DocumentReference describes some other document. This means that there are two sets of provenance information relevant here: the provenance of the document, and the provenance of the document reference. Sometimes, the provenance information is closely related, as when the document producer also produces the document reference, but in other workflows, the document reference is generated later by other actors. In the DocumentReference resource, the meta content refers to the provenance of the reference itself, while the content described below concerns the document it references. Like all resources, there is overlap between the information in the resource directly, and in the general Provenance resource. This is discussed as part of the description of the Provenance resource.

#### 1. List Resource
- Manages flat collections of resources
- Dynamic nature - items can be added/removed
- Supports curation with specific business meaning
- References other resources directly

#### 2. Group Resource
- Defines collections of specific entities (people, animals, devices)
- Can enumerate explicitly or describe qualifying characteristics
- Commonly used for:
  - Public health (at-risk populations)
  - Clinical trials (test subject pools)
  - Group-level operations/observations
