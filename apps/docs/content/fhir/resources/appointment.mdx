## Scope and Usage
Appointment resources provide information about planned meetings, whether future or past. Each resource represents a single meeting - repeating visits require multiple appointment resources. Examples include:
- Scheduled surgeries
- Follow-up clinical visits
- Clinical case conference calls
- Diagnostic equipment reservations

### Appointment Workflows
There are two typical workflows that occur with appointments:

#### Outlook Style - Community
These types of requests are typically handled by selecting a specific time from a list of available slots, then making the request for that timeslot.

#### Hospital Scheduling - Clinical
Clinical scheduling is often far more complex in its requirements and processing. Often this involves checking multiple availabilities across multiple systems and timing with other internal systems, not just those exposed by the Slot resources.

> **Implementation Note:** This type of clinical appointment scheduling has not been specifically covered with this definition of the Appointment resource (and other related resources). If you would like to contribute to the modification of this resource to cover these use cases, please contact the HL7 Patient Administration work-group.

Consideration should be given to situations where scheduling needs to be handled in more of a queue-like process.

### Basic Workflow

#### 1. Discovery/Addressing
- Determine address/endpoint details for scheduling
- Based on healthcare service type and formatting requirements
- Typically handled via Schedule resource

#### 2. Checking Availability (Optional)
- Review available times (Slot resources) on selected Schedule
- Available time doesn't guarantee booking success
- Booking system may apply additional qualifying criteria
  - Permissions
  - Assessments
  - Resource availability

#### 3. Making the Appointment Request
- Create new Appointment resource with `status="proposed"`
- All participants should have `status="needs-action"`
- System business rules may trigger automatic status updates

#### 4. Replying to the Request
- Handlers update participant statuses as needed
- Multiple systems create AppointmentResponse entries
- Overall Appointment status updated after all participants respond

#### 5. Checking Overall Status
- Requester monitors appointment status using FHIR pub-sub
- May restart process if rescheduling needed

#### 6. Waitlisting (Optional)
- Create waitlisted appointment when preferred times unavailable
- Requires two appointments:
  - Booked appointment in available slot
  - Waitlisted appointment with preferred `requestedPeriod`
- Patient notification process for new availability is implementation-specific

## Background and Context
The Appointment resource follows specific patterns and workflows that are important to understand for implementation.

### Request/Response Pattern
Appointments use a request-response pattern implemented through Appointment and AppointmentResponse resources:
- Initial requests use an Appointment with `status="proposed"` or `"pending"`
- Participants start with `status="needs-action"`
- Participants respond via AppointmentResponse resources
- Overall Appointment status updates after all responses received

The participant type property can specify required practitioner roles, even before specific actors are assigned. This property must match between Appointment-participant and AppointmentResponse for proper allocation.

### Relationship with Encounters
- Appointments are primarily administrative, while Encounters have clinical implications
- Encounters typically created when service starts, not at patient arrival
- Patient arrival marked by Appointment `status="arrived"`
- Emergency Room scenarios should use Encounters directly, not Appointments

### Integration Considerations
The Appointment pattern differs from typical FHIR order-response patterns to maintain compatibility with:
- iCal standard
- Non-clinical appointment systems
- Consumer-facing calendar applications

### Location Management
- Locations specified through participant references to Location or HealthcareService resources
- Enables schedule checking and conflict management
- Allows tracking of location availability
