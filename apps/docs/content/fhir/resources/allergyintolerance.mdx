## Scope and Usage
A record of a clinical assessment of an allergy or intolerance; a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have an adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.

Where a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterized by any harmful or undesirable physiological response that is specific to the individual and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance.

Substances include, but are not limited to: a therapeutic substance administered correctly at an appropriate dosage for the individual; food; material derived from plants or animals; or venom from insect stings.

## Background and Context

### Purpose
This resource provides a single place within the health record to document clinical statements about adverse reactions to substances/products, including:

- Recording clinical assessment of potential future reactions upon re-exposure
- Recording cumulative information about reactions to each exposure, including 'no reaction'

### Use Cases
Record information about adverse reaction risks for:
- Direct clinical care of an individual
- Managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance lists
- Information exchange about adverse reaction events
- Adverse reaction reporting
- Clinical decision support and alerts

### Scope
Can record reactions to:
- Biological & blood products
- Medicinal preparations (incipients and excipients)
- Foods
- Metal salts
- Organic chemical compounds

### Types of Adverse Reactions

#### Allergy
- Typically type I hypersensitivity
- Includes other "allergy-like" reactions and pseudoallergy

#### Intolerance
- Non-immune adverse reactions
- Not determined/perceived to be allergic
- Idiosyncratic and individually specific
- Not expected to occur in most patients under similar circumstances

> **Note:** In clinical practice, distinguishing between allergy and intolerance can be difficult. If uncertainty exists, the `type` element should be omitted.

### Important Considerations

#### Individual Sensitivity
- Reactions must be unique to the individual
- Distinguished from circumstantial reactions like:
  - Food/drug toxicity
  - Overdose
  - Drug-drug interactions
  - Drug-food interactions
  - Drug-disease interactions

#### Recording Guidelines
1. **Causative Substance:**
   - Must identify a proposed causative substance or class
   - Use `verificationStatus` to indicate uncertainty
   - Create separate instances for multiple possible causes
   
2. **Substance Documentation:**
   - Can record specific substances (e.g., amoxicillin, oysters, bee sting venom)
   - Can record class of substances (e.g., penicillins)
   - Exact substance can be recorded per exposure

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Default `criticality` should be 'Low Risk'
   - Set to 'High Risk' if re-exposure is unsafe (e.g., after life-threatening anaphylaxis)

### Clinical Information Hierarchy

#### First-Level Information
- Previous clinical manifestations
- Information source/reporter
- Criticality flag

#### Second-Level Information
- Exposure event details
- Links to additional clinical information:
  - History
  - Examination
  - Diagnoses

### Related Resources

#### AllergyIntolerance vs RiskAssessment
- AllergyIntolerance: Specific substance reaction risks
- RiskAssessment: General patient risks not based on reactions

#### AllergyIntolerance vs Immunization.reaction
- Create separate AllergyIntolerance record if immunization reaction indicates allergy
- Most systems don't query immunization.reactions

### Misuse Prevention

Do NOT use this resource for:
- Physical stimuli reactions (use Condition instead):
  - Light
  - Heat
  - Cold
  - Pressure
  - Vibration
- Adverse events from:
  - Clinical process failures
  - Intervention errors
  - Product malfunctions
  - Incorrect dosage
  - Mislabeling
  - Procedure injuries
  - Overdose/poisoning
- Standalone adverse event reports
- Alerts (use Flag or DetectedIssue)
- Failed therapy documentation
