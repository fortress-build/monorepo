Basic is used for handling concepts not yet defined in FHIR, narrative-only resources that don't map to an existing resource, and custom resources not appropriate for inclusion in the FHIR specification.

## Intended Use Cases

The Basic resource is intended for use in three primary circumstances:

1. **Future HL7 Resources**
   - When an implementer needs a resource concept likely to be defined by HL7 in the future
   - Delays may be due to bandwidth issues, insufficient requirements, or lower prioritization

2. **Narrative-Only Constructs**
   - For content that doesn't map cleanly to existing resources
   - Examples include:
     - Combined aspects of several resources (e.g., Assessment + Plan)
     - Flexible content where the system can't predict narrative content structure

3. **Site-Specific Requirements**
   - Limited use for unique implementation needs
   - Not intended for requirements that won't be officially defined in HL7
   - Helps keep the FHIR specification manageable

### Non-Conformant Use Case

There is also a fourth circumstance, though this use is not conformant:

- When implementers want to represent standard resource information in a custom format
- While wire-format compatible, this prevents:
  - Safe processing
  - Proper querying
  - Analysis by other conformant systems

> **Note**: Implementers should use Basic whenever they need a resource that doesn't clearly fit one of the currently defined resources, regardless of which category their use case falls into.

## Background and Context
Basic defines only a minimal set of data elements - those necessary to identify what kind of resource it represents and those necessary to support resource compartmenting. All other data elements are represented using the extension mechanism. It's entirely possible to have a Basic resource instance with nothing other than narrative, a subject and code. And, in practice, that's all many systems will understand.
