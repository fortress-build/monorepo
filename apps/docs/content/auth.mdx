title: Nerve Authorization
description: Learn how Nerve allows providers and Hospital Systems to easily grant access-control to your application

## Our Philosophy

We believe that health data should be kept secure and only be in the hands of responsible parties. But we believe that it should be simple to grant access to those responsible parties.

Just like how Plaid makes it simple for consumers to grant access to their bank-account information, we aim to make a simple and secure way for hospital systems and providers to grant access to EHR information to responsible third-parties. 

## The Auth Process

To authorize with Nerve, we use OAuth2 standards. Nerve manages authorization and refresh tokens between you and the EHRs so you just need a single `client-id`.
